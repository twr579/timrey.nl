            <p>
                It took a long time for me to develop my interest in web development. Arriving at UT Austin in Fall 2019 as an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, my original plan was to focus on hardware classes. This desire stemmed from an engineering summer camp I attended way back in 2015, where I designed and built my first electrical circuit. As it turned out, circuitry wasn’t my cup of tea. I liked the problem solving and trial and error approach it involved, but it was a little too mathy for my taste, with little opportunity for expressing my creativity. I turned to software classes in C and Java, and these began to scratch that itch in my right brain, but it still wasn’t enough. Finally, near the end of 2020, I decided to teach myself HTML and CSS, and I instantly fell in love. Since then, I’ve picked up JavaScript and React.js, put hours of work into this website, and eagerly collaborated on two team projects (more details <a href="projects.php">on the projects page</a>). I’m hoping to turn this preoccupation into my occupation. If you think you can help me with that, or just want to learn more about me, check out my resume <a href="resume.pdf">here</a> or contact me <a href="contact.php">here</a>. Thanks!

            <h2>what i like</h2>
            <p>
                Outside of school, I like to read, and I’m particularly interested in classic American lit. I enjoy studying languages like Latin and German. I like to hike – and camp, when it isn’t too hot (I took the background image for this site on a trip to Hill Country State Natural Area in Bandera, TX). I also enjoy listening to music and playing the drums. The design for this website was inspired by the cover of one of my favorite albums, London Calling by The Clash (and its cover is based on an old Elvis album, I guess).
